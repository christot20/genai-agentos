Guardian's time off \\nprograms are designed to provide flexibility and inclusivity so colleagues can take the time away from work that they need. \\nAll exempt colleagues (colleagues who are ineligible for overtime) participate in MyTime, which allows you to take time off \\nwithout the restrictions of annual paid time off (PTO) allotments, accruals, or tracking. Non-exempt colleagues are \\nimmediately eligible for PTO upon joining the Company. The amount of PTO you are entitled to is based on your length of \\nservice.  \\nAt Guardian, we celebrate our diverse workforce and want you to be able to recognize the religious, cultural, civic, or \\npersonal days that are most important to you, so you\\u2019ll receive Company holidays off. \\nWe recognize that as it is important that you have the support, flexibility, and resources to focus on what matters most, so \\nyou can do your best. Upon the arrival of your new child (through birth, adoption, or placement for foster care) you are \\neligible for paid parental leave if you are the primary or secondary caregiver, allowing you more time to spend with your \\nfamily. \\nGuardian understands that colleagues who take FMLA leaves are dealing with difficult personal and family situations. To \\nsupport you during this time of need, Guardian provides you with up to 10 business days of paid family and medical leave for \\nFMLA eligible absences. \\nFlexible, hybrid work \\narrangements  \\nGuardian provides flexible contemporary work arrangements that balance purposeful in-office and remote work. \\nBright Horizons child and adult \\nback-up care, pet care, virtual \\ntutoring and test prep, and \\ncollege coaching \\nGuardian focuses on providing benefits that assist you in balancing the competing demands of work and home life. The \\nBright Horizons child and adult back-up care program can help you and your loved ones throughout all stages of life: from \\nday care for an infant to caring for an aging or disabled family member. You will receive access to affordable, high-quality, \\nconvenient care when you have a lapse or breakdown in a normal care arrangement. Through this program, you\\u2019ll also \\nreceive a benefit to help you take care of your furry family members, and will have access to virtual tutoring and test prep. \\nIf you are getting a child ready to go to college, the admissions process can be stressful and time-consuming. With the \\nBright Horizons College Coach program, you\\u2019ll receive personalized assistance from former college admissions and financial \\naid officers, who will help guide you and your student through the college application and admissions process. They provide \\none-on-one support, college essay review and more. \\nVirtual meditation classes \\nGuardian offers virtual guided meditation through the partnership with our onsite fitness center (The CLUB at Bethlehem), \\nso you can clear and refresh your mind.  \\nBody: Benefits for your physical well-being \\nMedical   \\nWe have partnered with both Cigna and Centivo to offer colleagues a choice in their medical plan offerings. All colleagues can \\nchoose from three medical plan options: (1) the Cigna High Deductible Plan (2) the Cigna High Deductible Plus Plan and (3) \\neither the Centivo Copay Plan or Cigna Copay Plan (availability of the Copay Plan is based on your home zip code). All three \\nplans provide comprehensive coverage, covering free in-network preventive care and outpatient behavioral health care \\n(subject to the deductible), and other services like hospital stays, urgent and emergency care. To protect you from \\ncatastrophic expenses, these plans all have an annual out-of-pocket maximum, which is the most you will pay out-of-pocket \\nfor care during the year. \\nThe Cigna high deductible plans provide in- and out-of-network coverage and requires that a deductible be met for all other \\nservices. The Cigna Copay plan offers in-network coverage only (except for emergency care), a small deductible, and \\npredictable costs for office visits. And, under the Cigna High Deductible Plus and Copay Plans, you will receive an enhanced \\nbenefit when you receive care from Tier 1 providers, who meet specific guidelines for quality and cost-effective care.  \\nThe Centivo Copay Plan provides in-network coverage only (except for emergency care), free care from your primary care \\ndoctor for both preventive and sick visits, no deductible, and fixed costs for specialists and other medical care. This is a \\nunique medical plan option that is centered around your relationship with your primary care doctor, who helps you to save \\ntime and money, by guiding your health care journey. \\nThe plans generally cover the same treatments and services; however, the difference between the Cigna high deductible \\nplans, Cigna Copay Plan, and Centivo Copay Plan are the contributions you will pay, and your out-of-pocket expenses.  \\nPrescription Drugs   \\nWhen you enroll in a Guardian medical plan, you will automatically be enrolled in prescription drug coverage through CVS \\nCaremark. CVS Caremark provides coverage for generic and brand name medications filled at an in-network retail pharmacy, \\nand the CVS Caremark specialty and mail order pharmacies.  \\nIf you are enrolling in either of the Cigna high deductible plans, once you meet the combined medical-prescription drug \\ndeductible, you will pay the applicable copayment/coinsurance amount for non-preventive medications. Guardian also \\nprovides enhanced coverage for certain medications used to prevent the onset of a disease or serious medical condition. If \\nyou are taking one of these medications, you will not need to meet the deductible and will only pay the applicable copayment \\nor coinsurance amount. \\nIf you are enrolling in either the Cigna or Centivo Copay Plan, you do not need to meet a deductible. You will immediately \\nbegin paying the copay amount for all medications.  \\n2nd.MD Second Opinion \\nSupport \\nGuardian partners with 2nd.MD to offer medical plan members access to a second opinion service. When you are faced with a \\ncritical health care decision and are unsure what treatment option is best, 2nd.MD connects you with board-certified experts \\nfor a second opinion, via phone or video 24/7, at no cost to you or your family. \\nDental   \\nThe Guardian PPO dental plan provides you and your loved ones with coverage for preventive, basic, major restorative, and \\northodontia services, both in- and out-of-network, up to the annual plan limits. The deductible is waived for all in-network \\npreventive care. Plus, to ensure that we are helping our youngest family members take care of their smiles, the plan offers the \\nEarly Smiles Program, which provides 100% in-network coverage for preventive, basic and major services for children under \\nage 13, with no deductible. In addition to in-person visits, all members also have access to urgent dental care through \\nGuardian\\u2019s partnership with Teledentistry.com.  \\nAs an added feature under the Guardian plan, you and your covered dependents have access to roll over a portion of your \\nunused annual dental maximum into a personal Maximum Rollover Account (MRA), which can be used in future years, should \\nyou reach the annual ", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "human", "name": null, "id": "10fa0836-4e68-4894-9218-b798c8f79618", "example": false}, "execution_time": 6.140786390999892, "output": {"content": "The provided text outlines Guardian's comprehensive benefits program, which emphasizes flexibility, inclusivity, and support for employees' personal and professional lives.
